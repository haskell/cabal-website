  and so that once <CODE

>Since it is obviously the compilers that do the actual compilation,
the task of <CODE

><CODE
CLASS="CLASSNAME"

libraries once a new Haskell Implementation is installed.  This is an important
function, as it solves the problem of binary incompatibility between
Haskell Implementations and versions thereof.  Another very useful function that
<CODE
CLASS="CLASSNAME"

<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/bin/haskell</TT

program using the default compiler or throws the user into the default
interpreter, depending upon how it is invoked.  This allows Haskell
scripts (such as Setup.lhs) to be distributed with a

  options for the operating systems that Haskell modules are being
  installed on. (For instance, different operating systems have different
  policies for where to put documentation, source code, binary files,
  and libraries.)  Such information will most likely be read from a
  file that can be edited by the system administrator (<A

  <CODE
