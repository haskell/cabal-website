        prepares to build the package.  For sophisticated packages,

        record its results, but the name and format of this file are

specifies which compiler to use.  At most one of the value of these flags may be specified.
The configure step checks
that the compiler is available, in a sufficiently up-to-date form for the package, and that the package
expects to work with that compiler.  If the compiler name
is not specified, <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>setup</VAR

(often platform-specific) if the flag is not specified.

><P
>The reason for the <VAR
CLASS="OPTION"

>
        flag is that Roland RPM wants to create an exact installation
        tree, all ready to bundle up for the target machine,
        <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>but in a temporary location</I

        use this location for <VAR
CLASS="OPTION"
>--prefix</VAR
> in the
        <VAR
CLASS="OPTION"
>configure</VAR
> step, because that might bake
        the wrong path into some compiled files.  Nor does he want to
        register this temporary tree with the compiler on his
        machine. Instead, he bundles up the temporary installation
        tree, plus the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>installed-pkg-descr</TT
>, and
        ships them all to the target machine.  When they are installed
        there, the post-installation script runs
        <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>hc-pkg</B
> on the
        <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>installed-pkg-descr</TT
> file.
	    </P
><P
>Note that there is no <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>uninstall</B
>
        command in the setup script.  While it would be easy enough to
        implement in the simple build infrastructure, we don't want to
        require make-based build systems to implement <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>make
        uninstall</VAR
>, which is fairly non-standard and
        difficult to get right.  In the majority of cases, we expect
        libraries to be installed via a package manager (eg. RPM,
        Debian APT), which already provide uninstallation
        services.</P
